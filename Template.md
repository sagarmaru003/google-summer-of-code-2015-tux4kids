# Introduction #

General information about our project and our software can be found at the websites:
  * Tux Paint: http://www.tuxpaint.org
  * Tux Math and Tux Typing: http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org


# You #
  * Name
  * University / current enrollment
  * Short bio / overview of your background
  * Subscribe to the mailing list of the appropriate group and introduce yourself
  * Tell us your IRC nick with which you will use the group's IRC channel

# Your Coding Skills #
In your application let us know
  * What platform do you use to code? Hardware specifications and operating system. (Note that while Tux4Kids apps are cross-platform from a user standpoint, they are native Linux apps, and it would be far easier to simply install the distro of your choice on some empty drive space than to try to set up a development environment on another platform).
  * Did you ever code in C or C++? What is your experience?
  * If you are planning to do mobile/HTML development with Javascript or Lua, what is your experience?
  * If you apply for a project on our ideas list, have you experience in the areas listed under "Desired knowledge"?

# Set yourself up #
  * Set up your platform to build a Git/CVS snapshot of the current state of the project you are interested in.
  * If you need help, ask on the mailing list of the appropriate group.
  * Report success on the mailing list.

# You and Us #
  * Were you involved in Tux4Kids development in the past? What was your contribution?
  * Were you involved in other OpenSource development projects in the past? which, when and in what role?
  * Why have you chosen your development idea and what do you expect from your implementation?

# Your Project #
  * What do you want to achieve?
  * If you have chosen an idea from our list, why did you choose this specific idea?
  * If you are proposing a project of your own, what is unique about it?
  * What makes you suited to carry the project?
  * How much time do you plan to invest in the project before, during and after the Summer of Code (We expect full time 40h/week during GSoC, but better make this explicit)?
  * Please provide a schedule of how this time will be spent on subtasks of the project. While this is only preliminary, you will be required to provide a detailed plan latest at the beginning of GSoC and during the project you will issue weekly progress reports against that plan.

# Finally #
Your project must be focused and realistic. In order to pass, your code should be documented, tested, and merged into the parent project at the end of GSoC 2015. A partially-completed projected that is documented and merged will be evaluated much more favorably than a fully-coded but undocumented project that is left languishing in an abandoned branch. So, write a proposal that shows that you know what needs to be done and how to do it. Overly broad or vague proposals will lead us to believe that you don't really know what you are talking about.
